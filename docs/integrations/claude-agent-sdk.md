# Claude Agent SDK (signer RPC)

> **Stable:** tested with [`tests/adapter_contract.py`](../../tests/adapter_contract.py) against the pinned library on every push to main
> and every pull request ([what's stable](../support.md)).

`tracekit.integrations.claude_agent_sdk.tracekit_hooks` gates the tools of a Claude Agent SDK (Python) agent. Before
each tool call it asks the Tracekit signer for a policy decision; after the tool runs it records the outcome.
`TracekitSessionStore` wraps your `SessionStore` and commits every saved transcript to the signer. Both work with a
`tracekit.sdk.client.Client` or any object that implements the signer RPC (`tracekit.signer.rpc_schema.SignerAPI`),
including `tracekit.testing.FakeSigner`.

## Install

```bash
pip install tracekit-ai "claude-agent-sdk>=0.2.165,<0.3"
```

Python 3.10 or newer (the SDK's own requirement).

## Setup

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions, query
from tracekit.integrations.claude_agent_sdk import TracekitSessionStore, tracekit_hooks
from tracekit.sdk.client import Client

signer = Client()
run = signer.register_run({"agent": {"name": "repo-agent"}})
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    hooks=tracekit_hooks(signer, run),
    session_store=TracekitSessionStore(my_store, signer, run),   # optional: only if you mirror sessions to a store
)
async for message in query(prompt="fix the failing test", options=options):
    ...
signer.close_run({"run_id": run["run_id"], "run_token": run["run_token"]})
```

Register the run when the session starts and close it after the message loop. The CLI doesn't send the SDK's hooks
`SessionEnd` (checked with claude-agent-sdk 0.2.165 and 0.2.181, CLI 2.1.294 and 2.1.323), so a run the app leaves open
closes only at the signer's idle timeout (`idle_s`, an hour by default), with the reason `idle_timeout` rather than
the session's own. The hooks still close it at `SessionEnd` if a CLI sends one; `tracekit.instrument()` closes its run
when the process exits.

To add hooks of your own, extend the lists in the mapping. Tools run in the CLI subprocess under their Claude Code
names (`Bash`, `Edit`, `Write`, ...), so the signer's coding packs apply to them as they do to the Claude Code hook.

### With a tool executor

A [tool executor](../executor.md) decides and records its own actions (tier T2), so the hooks leave them to it. Hand
the hooks the `mcp_servers` you give `ClaudeAgentOptions`:

```python
from tracekit.integrations import executor_tools as ex

servers = {ex.SERVER: ex.claude_agent_sdk(ex.actions("https://executor.internal:8090", run, headers=auth))}
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(mcp_servers=servers, hooks=tracekit_hooks(signer, run, mcp_servers=servers))
```

The hooks skip a call only when its tool name is exactly `mcp__tracekit-executor__<action>` for an action of the server
`ex.claude_agent_sdk` built, and that server is under `ex.SERVER` in `mcp_servers`. They gate every other tool,
including a server a project `.mcp.json` adds under that name (or one whose name starts with it). Without
`mcp_servers`, the executor's calls are decided twice: by the hooks and by the executor. `tracekit.instrument()` passes
each `ClaudeAgentOptions`' own `mcp_servers` for you.

## What is recorded

| When | RPC | Sent |
|---|---|---|
| PreToolUse | `decide` | `tool_use_id`, tool name, the tool input as the CLI sends it (`parsed`) |
| PreToolUse, right before it runs | `approval_consume` | the same call and arguments, and the approval id when the hook waited for one |
| PostToolUse / PostToolUseFailure | `complete` | `status` `ok` or `error`, a `sha256:` commitment to the tool response (not the response), or the error message |
| after each `SessionStore.append` | `state_write` | the transcript's digest and the digest it started from (`prev_digest`) |
| SessionEnd, if the CLI sends it (it doesn't today: the app closes the run) | `close_run` | the CLI's reason |

## What the model said

No hook carries the model's messages: hand each message of `query()` (or `ClaudeSDKClient.receive_response()`)
to `tracekit_said`. It records each `AssistantMessage`'s thinking (a summary, with its signature), text and tool uses,
under the `tool_use_id`s the PreToolUse hook decides them by. A tool executor's call is recorded under its action's
name: the hook notes its `tool_use_id` for the executor server's handler, which hands it to the executor, so the
executor decides the call under the model's id.

```python
from tracekit.integrations.claude_agent_sdk import tracekit_said

said = tracekit_said(signer, run)
async for message in query(prompt="close ACC-9", options=options):
    await said(message)
```

Opus 4.7 and later return only the thinking's signature unless asked: `ClaudeAgentOptions(thinking={"type":
"adaptive", "display": "summarized"})`. The message itself is kept only when the signer's content vault is on; without it the record holds a commitment. A message that can't be recorded only warns. Which frameworks and providers return readable reasoning, and how to turn it on: [reasoning](../reasoning.md).

## Decisions

- **allow**: the tool runs.
- **deny**: the hook answers `permissionDecision: deny`. The model gets `Tool call blocked by policy: <rule ids>` as the
  tool's error result and the session goes on.
- **ask**: the hook opens an approval in the signer and holds the call until a person approves or rejects it there
  (CLI, web), for at most `APPROVAL_WAIT_S` (540 s). The PreToolUse matcher's timeout is set to `HOOK_TIMEOUT_S`
  (600 s), so the hook answers before the CLI gives up on it. A call not approved in time, or rejected, is denied.

Every call that is not denied runs only after the signer's `approval_consume` agrees: nothing the SDK holds is taken
as proof that no approval is needed. If the signer cannot be reached, the call is denied unless the run's `fail_modes`
make its tool class fail open (closed by default).

The gate is the PreToolUse hook, not the `can_use_tool` permission callback: the CLI skips `can_use_tool` for calls
its permission mode or allow rules approve (`bypassPermissions`, `allowed_tools`), while PreToolUse runs for every call.
The hook returns no opinion on an allowed call, so your permission settings still apply on top.

## Session store (L1)

`TracekitSessionStore(store, signer, run)` passes every call to your store. After each `append` it sends
`state_write` with the digest of the transcript (canonical JSON of each entry, chained, so a store that reorders JSON
keys gives the same digest) and the digest the transcript had before (`prev_digest`). When a session resumes from the
store, `load` recomputes the digest from what the store gives back; if the transcript was changed in the store since
the last write, the next write starts from another digest than the signer recorded, and the signer writes a signed
`capture.gap` of kind `state_tamper`. The signer compares writes within one run: resume the session in the same run
(same `run_id` and `run_token`) for the check to apply.

## Not covered

- The hook holds a call while it waits for an approval: there is no saved state to resume in a new process, so a wait
  longer than `APPROVAL_WAIT_S` ends in a denial and the model may try again.
- The CLI gives every tool use its own `tool_use_id` and runs it once, so every call is attempt 0.
- A store that keeps an entry twice (a retried append without de-duplication by `uuid`) changes the transcript's
  digest, and the next resume records a `state_tamper`.
- The LLM gateway's verified tool results (signer.yaml `verify_tool_results`) can't be used with this integration: it records the structured tool response, not what the model is sent, so every result would mismatch ([gateway](../gateway.md#verified-tool-results)).
