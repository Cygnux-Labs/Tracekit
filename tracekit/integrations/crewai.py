"""Tracekit for CrewAI (docs/integrations/crewai.md): CrewAI's global tool hooks decide every tool call before it runs
(an `ask` waits for a person) and record its outcome after. `tracekit.instrument()` registers them.

CrewAI runs the tool when a before hook raises, so these hooks never raise: the before hook blocks by returning False
on anything but an allow or an approved ask (a deny, a rejection, a refusal, an outage under a closed fail mode, an
error of its own), and the after hook gives the model Tracekit's reason instead of CrewAI's "blocked by hook". CrewAI's
hooks carry no tool-call id, so each call gets one of its own, which the after hook finds in a context variable (a
call's hooks run in one context). CrewAI hands the after hook a failed tool's exception as text: "Error executing
tool: ..." on native tool calls, "I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. ..." on its text (ReAct) path.
Either is recorded as an error, the rest as the result the model reads. On the text path CrewAI retries a failing
tool inside one call of its hooks, so the retries run under the call's one decision (docs/limits.md).
