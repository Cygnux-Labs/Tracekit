"""Browser Use (tested with browser-use 0.13.11 and 1.x): every action the agent's Tools run (navigate, click, input,
extract, upload_file, evaluate, custom actions) is decided by the signer before it runs and recorded after.

    from browser_use import Agent, Tools
    from tracekit.integrations.browser_use import trace_tools
    run = signer.register_run({"request_id": "r1", "agent": {"name": "shopper"}})
    tools = trace_tools(Tools(), signer, run)
    agent = Agent(task=..., llm=..., tools=tools, sensitive_data={"https://*.shop.example": {"pw": "..."}})

An action is recorded as `browser_use:<action>` with its params and the URL of the page it ran on (`page_url`) as args.
`sensitive_data` values reach the signer in none of the forms a URL, a page or JSON writes them in: the args keep
Browser Use's `<secret>name</secret>` placeholders (a value in the params, the page URL, a result or the page's text,
written out or percent-, HTML- or JSON-encoded, is put back to its placeholder), and each secret the action types is
added as `typed_secrets: {name: [sha256 of the value]}`, so the signed args commitment lets an auditor who holds the
value and the record's revealed salt confirm what was typed. Before an action is decided, every browser state Browser
Use made since the session's last action (what the model read of the page: URL, title, tabs and the page's text) is
observed as untrusted content, so the hosts it names are in the run's provenance index; one that can't be observed
refuses the action unless the run's fail mode for `browser` is open. `deny` skips the action and hands the agent an
ActionResult with the refusal as its error, and the run goes on. `ask` waits for a person (HeldCalls) up to
`approval_wait_s`, which ends before Browser Use's own action timeout; an approval with a T2 executor runs the params of
the signer's copy.
