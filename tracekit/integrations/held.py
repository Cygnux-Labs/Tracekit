"""The signer steps of an adapter that holds each call in the client until the signer lets it run (MCP, Browser Use):
decide, wait for a person on `ask`, consume, complete. When the consume returns the signer's copy of the arguments (an
approval with a T2 executor), the call runs those, not the ones the caller holds.

A signer that cannot be reached when a call is decided: the call runs unrecorded if register_run's `fail_modes` say
`open` for the adapter's class, else it is refused. Any other failure to decide or approve refuses the call. A failure
to record an outcome warns and changes nothing the caller sees. An approval no one answered by the end of the wait, or
whose wait the framework cancelled (its own timeout), is withdrawn (approval_abandon), so no one can answer it later.
