"""LangChain v1 middleware: every tool call is decided by the signer before it runs and recorded after.

    from tracekit.integrations.langchain import TracekitMiddleware
    run = signer.register_run({"request_id": "r1", "agent": {"name": "my-agent"}})
    agent = create_agent(model, tools, checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
                         middleware=[TracekitMiddleware(signer, run["run_id"], run["run_token"],
                                                        fail_modes=run.get("fail_modes"))])

`deny` replaces the call with an error ToolMessage and the run goes on. `ask` pauses the run with LangGraph
`interrupt()`; resume it with `Command(resume={"approval_id": ...})`. A call whose approval was answered before the
resume doesn't pause again, so of two calls of one ToolNode that ask, the one a person approved runs on resume and the
other, still waiting, is refused. Every call that is not denied runs only after the
signer's `approval_consume` agrees, so an approval is checked by the signer, never by the saved state; an approval with
a T2 executor runs the arguments the consume returns. `ask` needs a checkpointer: without one the call is denied.

A signer that cannot be reached when a call is decided: the call runs unrecorded if register_run's `fail_modes` say
`open` for the tool's class (as the signer's default policy classes it), else it is refused. Any other failure to
decide or approve (a refusal, a run the signer closed after its idle timeout: register a new run for a long-idle agent)
refuses the call. A failure to record the outcome warns and leaves
the tool's result as it was. Put TracekitMiddleware last in `middleware=`: a middleware after it could hand the tool a
call other than the one decided.
A graph built on `ToolNode` without `create_agent` uses `tracekit_tool_node(tools, signer, run)`, the same gate.
Its `ask` pauses whatever the node's `handle_tool_errors`, and through `.with_fallbacks()`: neither hands the pause to
the error handling or the fallbacks. Any other wrapper that catches the interrupt (GraphInterrupt) swallows the pause:
the call does not run and its approval expires.
`TracekitCheckpointer(saver, signer, run)` commits every checkpoint the saver writes to the signer (L1).
Each model response under `create_agent` is recorded too (tracekit.integrations.said): its reasoning blocks (with the
provider's signature or encrypted content), an open model's `reasoning_content` and text, and each call of the agent's
tools, under the id it is decided by, as a call of that response only once it reaches the gate (or a tool executor's
tool): a call another middleware stops first (a person's reject in HumanInTheLoopMiddleware, ToolCallLimitMiddleware,
the graph's recursion limit) is not recorded, so the signer never reads it as one that ran with no decision. A call a
person edited there is recorded as the model asked for it and decided as edited: reconcile reads it as args_mismatch.
A response that can't be recorded only warns. A `tracekit_tool_node` graph has no model hook: its model calls are
recorded by `tracekit.instrument()` or the LLM gateway.
