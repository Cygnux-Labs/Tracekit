"""Claude Agent SDK (Python): every tool call is decided by the signer before it runs and recorded after.

    from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions, query
    from tracekit.integrations.claude_agent_sdk import TracekitSessionStore, tracekit_hooks
    run = signer.register_run({"request_id": "r1", "agent": {"name": "my-agent"}})
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(hooks=tracekit_hooks(signer, run),
                                 session_store=TracekitSessionStore(my_store, signer, run))   # the store is optional
    said = tracekit_said(signer, run)   # optional: what the model said before each call
    async for message in query(prompt="...", options=options):
        await said(message)

The gate is the PreToolUse hook, not `can_use_tool`: the CLI skips `can_use_tool` for every call its permission mode or
allow rules approve, while PreToolUse runs for every call. `deny` blocks the call with the reason, which the model
gets as the tool's error result, and the session goes on. `ask` holds the call in the hook until a person decides in
the signer, for at most APPROVAL_WAIT_S, below the hook's own timeout (HOOK_TIMEOUT_S, set on the matcher); a call not
approved by then is blocked. Every call that is not denied runs only after the signer's `approval_consume` agrees; an
approval with a T2 executor runs the arguments it returns (the hook's `updatedInput`).
PostToolUse and PostToolUseFailure complete the call against its decision; SessionEnd closes the run. The tools of
the tool executor's server (executor_tools.claude_agent_sdk, named `tracekit-executor`) are left to the executor: the
hook only notes the call's tool_use_id for the server's handler, which hands it to the executor to decide under.

A signer that cannot be reached when a call is decided: the call runs unrecorded if register_run's `fail_modes` say
`open`, else it is blocked. Any other failure to decide or approve (a refusal, a run the signer closed after its idle
timeout: register a new run for a long-idle agent) blocks the call. A failure to record the outcome only warns.

No hook carries the model's messages: `tracekit_said` records each AssistantMessage the app's message loop hands it
(tracekit.integrations.said): its thinking (with its signature), text and tool uses, under the tool_use ids the
PreToolUse hook decides them by (a tool executor's under its action's name, as the executor decides it). A message
that can't be recorded only warns.
