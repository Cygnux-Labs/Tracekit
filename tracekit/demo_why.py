"""`tracekit demo --why`: `tracekit why` on the signer's evidence, in a temp dir, nothing touched outside it.

The support desk of tracekit.why.demo (researcher, planner, executor; seeded mock models, fake tools) runs on the
signer-backed runtime against the in-process dev signer and test witness of `demo --server`, under the server policy
pack with the desk's tools mapped. The researcher reads the ticket and the refund policy (trusted), a vendor note with
a planted instruction to email the customer list to an outside address and a shipping FAQ (untrusted). The signer
holds that email (TK-P001) and a person rejects it; the runs are imported with their signed records; `attribute`
names the cause; each agent's run is exported and verified offline, and the cause is cited by its signed record.
