"""Kernel sensor import (experimental): the process, connect and file events a kernel sensor exports as JSON lines,
recorded by the v2 signer in the run each is attributed to, as effect.observed under the import's own signer identity
(observe_effect with `sensor`). Tetragon and Falco: docs/integrations/tetragon.md, docs/integrations/falco.md.

    tracekit sensor import --config sensor.yaml [FILE]   # FILE: an export file, followed (with --follow) through
                                                        # rotation; none: stdin (`tetra getevents -o json | ...`,
                                                        # Falco's program_output)

sensor.yaml:
    sensor: tetragon                       # or falco
    signer: https://signer.internal:8443   # the import's own identity: $TRACEKIT_SIGNER_* (tracekit.sdk.client),
                                           # granted observe_effect in signer.yaml authorize
    runs:                                  # which processes are an agent's, and whose runs their events go to
      - match: {namespace: agents, pod: "coder-*"}   # globs over namespace, pod, container (id) and uid; all must match
        caller: k8s_sa:system:serviceaccount:agents:coder   # that identity's latest open run takes the event

The first `runs` entry that matches an event attributes it; an event none matches is not an agent's and is skipped,
as are a connect to no IP address (a unix socket's) and kinds of event the import doesn't record (each counted on stderr
at exit). The import covers only the runs of its `caller`s, which every call names (`callers`). Losses go to the signer
as `lost`, an observer_lost gap in each run the import covers: the ones the sensor reports in its stream, lines the
import can't read, an agent's events it can't record (no binary, a field the signer would refuse), and events past
MAX_PENDING while the signer can't take them. Every call is the import's heartbeat; one goes at least every
HEARTBEAT_S. Each call names this process (`instance`), so the signer sees a restart.
