"""Signer-side detection: the policy's sequences and limits, and the triggers that open incidents.

A pure function of signed records. The single writer feeds every record to `observe` as Tx.emit writes it, replay
feeds the log after the snapshot, and `tracekit policy backtest` feeds stored runs or bundles. Work per record is a few
dict lookups (no regex); the state grows with the policy's rules and the scopes they key on, not with calls, and is JSON
so `RecordLog._state()` snapshots it.

The names of a decision are its rule ids (the union of both class readings: `detect.rule_ids` when it differs from
`rule_ids`), each rule's `label`, and `*`; a call whose class is unknown matches every step and limit (fail closed). A
call counts when it was allowed (allow, flag) or, for ask, once the approval of that decision is consumed; never when
denied. One call advances each partial sequence by one step, or through consecutive steps its own names match (each
name once; never through `*` or an unknown class). A sum limit reads the amount and currency the signer put in
`detect.sums`. Windows are fixed: one starts at the first call counted and runs `window` seconds of the records' `ts`
(the signer's clock).

An incident carries its trigger's `respond` mode, no actions, and `would` the configured action; the signer acts on
`mode: enforce` ones before writing them (SignerService._respond fills `actions`). Only opened incidents count toward
the caps; an open incident is updated at most once per window.
