# Changelog

All notable changes to Tracekit. Versions follow [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/).

## 0.2.0rc1

First release candidate of v0.2: the signed evidence-bundle core, live observer and custom-agent SDK.
This entry lists the fixes from the production-hardening review on top of the v0.2 development branch.

### Fixed
- **A write to a path containing a NUL byte was not flagged on some Python and OS combinations.** The
  out-of-scope check relied on `realpath` raising; it now treats an embedded NUL as out of scope explicitly.
- **Tests assumed Linux.** Approvals used GNU `script -c` and `SO_PEERCRED`; they now use a stdlib `pty` helper
  and `peercred.has_peer_credentials()`. The full suite passes natively on macOS 26 (arm64, Python 3.9.6).
- **A retrying client could flood the ledger with `error` events** (47,947 records from one invalid event).
  Rejections are now recorded for the first 10 repeats per run and message, then once per power of ten.
- **Trusted-key files whose raw 32-byte key began or ended with a whitespace byte were mis-stripped**
  and rejected (a roughly 5% flaky failure). Raw keys are no longer stripped.
- **TK-D004 (`rm -rf /`) had super-linear regex behaviour** on adversarial input; it is rewritten linearly.
- **`tracekit init` crashed on a normal install.** `_hook_command()` built its command inside the
  `except` branch, so `tracekit init --dev` raised `UnboundLocalError` and wrote no hooks.
- **The observer replay showed `CHAIN ✗ TAMPERED` for every v0.2 run.** The browser re-hashed the
  translated display records instead of the raw ledger records. Replays now embed the raw records and
  verify the real hash chain; a one-byte edit still turns the badge red.
- **Canonical JSON could differ between Python and the browser** (`2.0` vs `2`, key order for
  characters outside the BMP), which could make a valid bundle look broken in `replay.html`.
- **The verifier could crash on a malformed bundle.** It now reports a failed check instead, rejects
  duplicate zip members and zip bombs, flags files the manifest does not list, cross-checks the
  manifest range, and no longer lets the (unsigned) manifest narrow which runs get checked.
- **Git witness retries failed** with "nothing to commit" after a partial publish, and `git init -b`
  needs git 2.28+. Publishing is idempotent and works with older git.
- **A lone UTF-16 surrogate, `NaN` or deeply nested JSON in an agent's output** could make the signer
  drop the event or a redaction recurse without bound. Events are sanitised before signing.
- **The SDK could raise inside the agent** on sets, bytes, datetimes or `NaN` in tool arguments or
  results. Values are coerced; `Tracer` is now a context manager that always records `run.end`.
- **Hook** no longer crashes on a non-object `tool_input` or malformed transcript lines, creates its
  state directory if missing, and hashes the transcript in a stream instead of reading it twice into memory.
- **Policy** validation rejects non-numeric `checkpoint_every` / `approval_timeout_s` and non-boolean
  flags; evaluation no longer fails on odd inputs or a path containing a NUL byte.
- **Settings files**: Tracekit refuses to touch a Claude Code settings file it cannot parse, writes
  atomically, and makes no new backup when nothing changes.
- **Dev setup** is idempotent (re-running `init --dev` no longer kills a healthy signer), and a stale
  pidfile can no longer cause an unrelated process to be signalled.
- **`tracekit uninstall --project`** no longer stops the shared dev signer.
- **Observer server**: Host-header allow-list against DNS rebinding, constant-time token check,
  Content-Security-Policy and other security headers, cached verification, resilient ledger tail,
  friendly errors for a busy port or a missing ledger.
- **Observer UI**: no third-party font request (the replay is now fully offline), real error states and
  automatic retry in live mode, phone layout, `<noscript>` note.
- **CLI**: `--version`, clear one-line errors instead of tracebacks (`TRACEKIT_DEBUG=1` restores them),
  approval ids may be abbreviated to a unique prefix, bad numeric options are rejected, `export --run`
  and `--since` are honoured.
- **Signer** takes a final checkpoint on Ctrl-C as well as SIGTERM, and tightens a group- or
  world-readable key file.

### Added
- Claude Code plugin and marketplace manifest (`plugin/`, `.claude-plugin/`), with `/tracekit-status`, `/tracekit-verify`, `/tracekit-pending`.
- Adapters: `tracekit.adapters.traced` (any function) and `tracekit.adapters.langchain` (LangChain / LangGraph), `tracekit[langchain]` extra.
- Remote ingestion: `tracekit ingest token|serve`, `tracekit init --remote`; token-authenticated, TLS, rate-limited, events recorded as namespaced `sdk` runs.
- Rekor witness (experimental): RFC 6962 inclusion proofs, signed-entry-timestamp check against a pinned key, `rekord` entries.
- macOS: `LOCAL_PEERCRED` caller attestation, `ps`-based process checks, and an experimental launchd system mode (`--experimental-macos`). `docs/portability.md`.
- `docs/sample/` (a real bundle, a tampered copy, the key), `docs/evaluation.md`, design-partner kit, review packet, `paper/v0.2-update-draft.md`.
- Default policy: TK-D010 (shell writes to credential files) and TK-D011 (sending key and cloud-credential files), and wider TK-D002 (pipes to python/perl/ruby/node, download-then-run) and TK-D004 (quoted `$HOME`, split flags).
- `tracekit init --no-hooks` now also applies to system mode.
- `action.yml`: a composite GitHub Action that runs `tracekit verify` on a bundle.
- `Makefile` (`make check`, `make eval`, `make demo`), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue and PR templates,
  a tag-driven release workflow with PyPI trusted publishing (`docs/RELEASING.md`).

### Changed
- The v0.1 prototype was removed (root scripts, `legacy/`, its tests, demo script and sample output, and the
  v0.1 experiment code). `tracekit migrate` still converts v0.1 ledgers. `tracekit_sdk.Tracer` is now the
  v0.2 signed SDK only; the unauthenticated `endpoint=` ingest mode is gone. The duplicate root `schema/` was removed.
- E1 (integrity) and E3 (policy gate) evaluations were rewritten for v0.2; E2/E4/E5 and the paper figure
  generators were v0.1-only and were removed (the paper in `paper/` describes v0.1).
- Observer: the live feed is bounded (`TRACEKIT_OBSERVE_MAX_RECORDS`, default 50000); `/api/snapshot` now returns
  `{next, dropped, records}`.
- Policy: regexes with a repeat of a repeat are rejected at load; each match has a 0.5 s budget (a timeout counts as
  a match); subjects are matched in overlapping 16 KiB windows so padding cannot push a command out of view, and a subject over 256 KiB is treated as matching (fail safe). Default rules no longer deny `.env.example`-style files or the word
  `sudo` inside `grep`/`echo` arguments (E3 benign false positives 3/40 to 0/40).
- An unreachable OTLP collector no longer aborts `tracekit export --otel-endpoint`; the bundle is still written.
- Exports (`tracekit export`, `tracekit observe --export`) are written atomically.
- Version is single-sourced from `tracekit/__init__.py`; packaging metadata, classifiers and sdist
  manifest added; CI workflow added.
