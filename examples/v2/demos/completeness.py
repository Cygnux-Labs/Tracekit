"""Completeness and tamper evidence: an agent's call is allowed but its result never comes back (the tool hung, the
process died, a post-call hook didn't fire). The signer, which saw the decision, writes a signed
`capture.gap{decided_not_completed}` when the run ends: the missing outcome is in the record, not silently absent.
Then a copy of the bundle with one byte changed (the gap's call id, call-2 to call-1) fails verification. Offline,
on the dev signer.
